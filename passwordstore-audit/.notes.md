# Notes

## Missing Access Control

- Function `setPassword` actually lets a non-owner caller to set a password. Anyone can set a password.

- Variable `s_password` is `private`. In the context of SCs, private only means that that variable only exists in the scope of the SC it is declared in. Hence, if the `PasswordStore.sol` contract gets imported and used in another contract, the `s_password` variable will not be available for out-of-scope use. BUT, it doesn't means it cannot be read on by anyone, because data on the blockchain is PUBLIC.
