# Protocol Summary

A smart contract applicatoin for storing a password. Users should be able to store a password and then retrieve it later. Others should not be able to access the password. 

# Disclaimer

Davide Scovotto makes all effort to find as many vulnerabilities in the code in the given time period, but holds no responsibilities for the findings provided in this document. A security audit by the team is not an endorsement of the underlying business or product. The audit was time-boxed and the review of the code was solely on the security aspects of the Solidity implementation of the contracts.

# Risk Classification

|            |        | Impact |        |     |
| ---------- | ------ | ------ | ------ | --- |
|            |        | High   | Medium | Low |
|            | High   | H      | H/M    | M   |
| Likelihood | Medium | H/M    | M      | M/L |
|            | Low    | M      | M/L    | L   |

We use the [CodeHawks](https://docs.codehawks.com/hawks-auditors/how-to-evaluate-a-finding-severity) severity matrix to determine severity. See the documentation for more details.

# Audit Details 

**The findings described in this document correspond the following commit hash:**

```

## Scope 

```

## Roles

- Owner: Is the only one who should be able to set and access the password.

For this contract, only the owner should be able to interact with the contract.

# Findings
## High

### [H-1] Storing the password on-chain makes it visible to anyone, and no longer private

**Description:** All data stored on-chain is visible to anyone, and can be read directly from the blockchain. The `PasswordStore::s_password` variable is intended to be a private variable and only accessed through the `PasswordStore::getPaasword` function, which is intended to be only called by the onwer of the contract.

We show one such method of reading any data off chain below.

**Impact:** Anyone can read the private password, severely breaking the functionality of the protocol.

**Proof of Concept:** (Proof of Code)

The below test case shows how anyone can read the password direcrly from the blockchain.

1. Create a locally running chain
```bash
make anvil
```

2. Deploy the contract to the chain
```bash
make deploy
```

3. Run the storage tool

We use `1` because that's the storage slot of the `s_password` in the contract.

```bash
cast storage <CONTRACT_ADDRESS_HERE> 1 --rpc-url http://127.0.0.1:8545
```

You'll get an output that looks like this:

`0x6d7950617373776f726400000000000000000000000000000000000000000014`

You can the parse that hex to a string with:

```bash
cast parse-bytes32-string 0x6d7950617373776f726400000000000000000000000000000000000000000014
```

And get an output of:

```
myPassword
```

**Recommended Mitigation:** Due to this, the overall architecture of the contract should be rethought. One could ecnrypt the password off-chain, and then store the encrypted password on-chain. This would require the user to remember another password off-chain to decrypt the password. However, you'd also likely want to remove the view function as you wouldn't want the user to accidentally send a transaction with the password that decrypts you password.


### [H-2] `PasswordStore::setPassword` has no access control, meaning a non-owner could change the password.

**Description:** The `PasswordStore::setPassword` function is set to be an `external` function, however, the natspec of the function and overall purpose of the smart contract is that `This function allows only the owner to set a new password.`

```javascript
    function setPassword(string memory newPassword) external {
@>      // @audit - There are no access controls
        s_password = newPassword;
        emit SetNetPassword();
    }
```

**Impact:** Anyone can set/change the password of the contract, severly breaking the contract intended functionality.

**Proof of Concept:** Add the following to the `PasswordStore.t.sol` test file.

<details>
<summary>Code</summary>

```javascript
    function test_anyone_can_set_password(address randomAddress) public {
        vm.assume(randomAddress != owner);
        vm.prank(randomAddress);
        string memory expectedPassword = "myNewPassword";
        passwordStore.setPassword(expectedPassword);

        vm.prank(owner);
        string memory actualPassword = passwordStore.getPassword();
        assertEq(actualPassword, expectedPassword);
    }
```

</details>

**Recommended Mitigation:** Add an access control conditional to the `PasswordStore::setPassword` function.

```javascript
if(msg.sender != s_owner) {
    revert PasswordStore__NotOwner();
}
```

## Informational

### [I-1] The `PasswordStore::getPassword` natspec indicates a patameter that doesn't exist, causing the natspec to be incorrect

**Description:** 

```javascript
    /*
     * @notice This allows only the owner to retrieve the password.
@>   * @param newPassword The new password to set.
     */
    function getPassword() external view returns (string memory) {
        if (msg.sender != s_owner) {
            revert PasswordStore__NotOwner();
        }
        return s_password;
    }
```

The `PasswordStore::getPassword` fucntion signature is `getPassword()` while the natspec says it should be `getPassword(string)`.

**Impact:** The natspec is incorrect.

**Recommended Mitigation:** Remove the incorrect natspec line.

```diff
-   * @param newPassword The new password to set.
```
